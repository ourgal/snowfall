#+title: My simple NixOS config

* Introduce

It's a NixOS config using [[https://github.com/snowfallorg/lib][snowfall]].

Almost all files in ~modules~ folder are minimal nix modules, its path is module option path.

For example:

#+begin_src nix
# modules/home/cli/android/default.nix
{
  nixPkgs = "apkeep";
  enable = "fdroidcl";
}
#+end_src

it will convert to:

#+begin_src nix
{
  lib,
  config,
  namespace,
  pkgs,
  ...
}:
let
  # folder path as option path
  cfg = config.${namespace}.cli.android;
in
{
  # create an enable option by default
  options.${namespace}.cli.android.enable = lib.mkOption {
    type = lib.types.bool;
    default = false;
    description = null;
  };

  config = lib.mkIf cfg.enable {
    home.packages = [ pkgs.apkeep ];

    # sub folder
    ${namespace}.cli.android.fdroidcl.enable = true;
  };
}
#+end_src

so, just a simple, lazy config.
